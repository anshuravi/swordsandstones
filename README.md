The story of the Arthurian legend has been one of my favorites ever since I was a child. It is truly a tale of bravery, love and magic. Everytime I heard the story I felt like I had been whisked off to a distant land ready for adventure. Through this project, I wanted the user to be able to experience some of the magic I felt hearing this story as a child. The minute I found this book on Project Gutenberg I knew I had to use it. The data I used includes places and character roles from the Arthurian legend as well as multiple swords in order to generate a scenario for the user to enjoy. I also added a dataset of medieval manuscript letter a's so to enhance the scroll's design and the user's experience. The overall user interaction is a button that states "click me for your destiny awaits." Once this button is pressed a scenario is generated for the user to enjoy.
